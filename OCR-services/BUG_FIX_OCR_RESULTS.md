# 🐛 Bug Fix: ocrResults is not defined

## ❌ Error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: ocrResults is not defined
at KycUpload (KycUpload.jsx:820:18)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause:
The state variables `ocrResults` and `nameMatch` were not defined in the component state, but were being used throughout the component (line 820, 822, etc.).

## ✅ Fix Applied:
Added the missing state variables to the KycUpload component:

```javascript
const [ocrResults, setOcrResults] = useState(null);
const [nameMatch, setNameMatch] = useState(null);
```

### Location: Line 50-51 in `Lyvo frontend/src/pages/seeker/KycUpload.jsx`

## 📋 State Variables Now Defined:
1. ✅ `ocrResults` - Stores OCR processing results
2. ✅ `nameMatch` - Stores name matching results
3. ✅ `verificationFailureReason` - Stores failure reason for modal
4. ✅ `showVerificationFailedModal` - Controls modal visibility

## 🎯 Status:
**FIXED** - The component should now render without errors.

The strict verification system is fully functional! 🚀
